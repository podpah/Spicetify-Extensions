# Reload Page

Filename : `reloadPage.js`

Topbar icon to reload the page

## To use:

* Click the button on the top bar and it'll refresh the page

P.S - When you reload, your history resets so the starter page becomes the one you're currently on and the page history gets reset so you can't use the next/previous page buttons

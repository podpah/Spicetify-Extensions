# Copy Playlist Info

Filename : `queueShuffler.js`

Shuffle your queue using a Durstenfeld/Fisher-Yates shuffle

## To use:

* Go to your queue and click the button

P.S - The extension adds/removes the button if there is/isn't a queue every 2.5s as it was either that or having it change on music swap or pause/play.
